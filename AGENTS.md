## Lotery Number more chances

You have to generate an app in spanish. use and read carefully this conversation to gain context. @conversation.md

La loteria del niño has five drums with 10 bolls each from 0 to 9. the idea is that the sum of the five digits ends doing a normal distribution. So it goes from 0 to 45. So the ideal distribution is between 22 and 23. The first premiss is that if a number sums 22 or 23 with their digits is ideal. There are 6000 numbers that sums 22 and 6000 numbers that sums 23. The second premiss is that if the number is between the gaus bell in the 12000 numbers is ideal. So that will be the 6000 numbers in the middle of the 12000 numbers that sums 22 and 23.

The app shall allow the user introude a number an gives the suitability of the number with a color and a message.

Red if the number does not satifisfy the premisses
Yellow if satisfy some of the premisses
Green if its perfect and satifisfy all the premises

Also The app Shall allow the user to generate five numbers.

You can select a check to take also into consideration numbers from past years so the positions are also ideal. Example, taking into account the past years the first position of the number more likely is 0 and that goes on with the rest of the five positions.

The app shall include a modal that explains the reasoning behind with some graphics.

The app shall be nice looking and well animated.
